# 📝 ToDo Express Servers

This repository demonstrates three different implementations of HTTP CRUD operations using Express.js for managing ToDos.

## 🚀 Project Overview

1. **In-Memory ToDo Server**: Performs CRUD operations on an in-memory variable.
2. **File-Based ToDo Server**: Performs CRUD operations on a file-based storage system for persistent ToDos.
3. **Users-Based ToDo Server**: Performs CRUD operations on a file-based storage system, with ToDos managed separately for different users.

## 💡 Tip
Use `Postman`
